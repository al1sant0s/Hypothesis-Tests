# Hypothesis-Tests


## About

Inspired by R functions: t.test, var.test and prop.test; this python package allows you to perform some basic hypothesis tests. Right now there are 6 types of
tests available, they are:

* One sample tests
    * T-student test for true value of mean.
    * Chi-squared test for true value of variance.
    * Z test for true value of proportion.
* Two sample tests
    * T-student test for the difference between two means.
    * F test for the ratio between two variances.
    * Z test for the difference between two proportions.

More tests might be added in the future.

## Instalation

Before using this package, you need to make sure to have installed numpy, scipy, matplotlib and prettytable onto your system.
